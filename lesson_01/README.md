# How to solve any problem? (Get used to `fast tests` & TDD)

> Please tell me about the last `bug` you had in your code? What was the problem and how much time/money it cost to you/company to fix it?

> Are `tests` required in your workplace? Do you write them? Do you like writing them?

In essence you follow three simple steps repeatedly:

- Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
- Write the functional code until the test passes.
- Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured.
